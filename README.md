# Introduction to Algorithms

This repository hold my notes and code for Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS) 4th Edition.

Code may be completed in various languages depending on their complexity and my current language focus at the time.

## Chapter 1

Nothing of note here besides some basic maths regarding BigO notation.

## Chapter 2

- Insertion sort: an efficient algorithm for sorting a small number of elements -> O(nlogn)
